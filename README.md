This is the third and last assignment for my networks class. It is an implementation of a linkstate algorithm used to determine the shortest path for packets, etc. Formatting works well for small networks sizes (n<7). Very specific input required based on assignment specifications. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented here as well.
